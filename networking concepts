<h1>Exploring Networking Concepts in Azure Using Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we explore networking configurations in Azure using Virtual Machines, including both Windows 10 and Ubuntu (Linux) VMs. We also investigate network traffic using various network protocols and tools. <br />

<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machines and Networking Concepts](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Provisioning Virtual Machines (Windows 10 and Ubuntu)
- Step 2: Configuring Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- Step 3: Inspecting Traffic Using Wireshark
- Step 4: Analyzing Results and Making Adjustments

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>
